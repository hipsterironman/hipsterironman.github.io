Hey. I'm Ryan. I graduated from UMD CS with a Bachelor's in May 2020, and am currently working from home in Maryland as a junior software engineer. I'm a new developer with a particular interest in React and Node applications, as well as compilers and AI. I like functional programming and clean code.

Outside of work, I play Smash (Fox/Peach main in Melee, Wolf in Ultimate) and write (weird postmodern stories like George Saunders). I run and like craft beer and good wine.

Topics I'll write about here will range from Javascript to weird musings on video games to whatever I happen to be thinking about at the time.

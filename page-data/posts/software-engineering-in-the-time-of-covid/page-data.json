Bear with me.</p>\n<p>Working from home seemed like such an obvious deal for much of my life. I’m introverted and focus well in silence, and I hate being perceived. If someone would pay me to write code incognito and deliver it to a client’s front door in an envelope with no return address (or, fine, with an anonymous email,) I would happily put in my hours without a second thought. The run up to my first post-undergrad job gave me a glimmer of hope that would be my situation due to Covid. Being forced to work in that way rather than choosing to wasn’t ideal, but nothing is ideal about Covid.</p>\n<p>It has been much more painful than I expected. I appreciate the safety it brings me and the immense privilege I exercise in having access to a job that allows remote work in the first place. Had I at least had a few months or so in an office, doing real work and not the fluff that my internship had me doing, I’m certain I’d feel much differently about it. Without that, though, I feel lost and like I cannot perform to the best of my abilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"help-is-distant\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#help-is-distant\" aria-label=\"help is distant permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Help is distant</h2>\n<p>I thought I’d enjoy messaging people for questions more than speaking to them. Most of my communication with my peers is text-based, after all, so wouldn’t it make sense for my work communication to be the same?</p>\n<p>The variable I ignored here is that messaging colleagues is essentially no different from emailing them. Writing emails feels like navigating a field of broken glass to make sure I use the most neutral language possible and convey my questions respectfully and DON’T USE THAT EXCLAMATION POINT I KNOW YOU WANT TO. Not to mention that the default notifications for the company messaging solution are a blinking blood red that take up, like, an eighth of the desktop with uncanny valley low-res profile pictures. They feel like I’ve just done something wrong. For a deeply anxious person like me, I might as well be calling them on the phone if the process of messaging will induce that much anxiety.</p>\n<h2 id=\"helplessness-is-constant\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#helplessness-is-constant\" aria-label=\"helplessness is constant permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Helplessness is constant</h2>\n<p>This was a problem with my internships, as well. Getting anything to do took a while because of sheer bureaucratic inertia. I went my first three days without a PC to remote into. The next two were solely devoted to setting up my developer workstation—an impenetrable maze of half-documented procedure, most of which seems to be known only in oral tradition, inaccessible unless I spam my colleagues with messages.</p>\n<p>The next couple days were spent waiting for an assignment, which I could at least spend frolicking through the codebase, but did not feel any more productive. Doing nothing weighed on me. It was difficult to divorce feelings of waiting for work to do from feeling like I was swindling my company.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/software-engineering-in-the-time-of-covid","tagSlugs":["/tag/software-engineering/","/tag/web-development/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-08-10","description":"Perspectives from a new junior developer whose first job began remotely in the midst of Covid.","tags":["Software Engineering","Web Development"],"title":"Software Engineering in the Time of Covid","socialImage":"/media/42-line-bible.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/software-engineering-in-the-time-of-covid"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
